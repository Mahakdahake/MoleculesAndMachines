AI-Powered Protein Binders for SARS-CoV-2 Entry

This project explores the use of AI tools like AlphaFold and Chimera to design and visualize smart protein binders that target SARS-CoV-2 entry points.

Techniques Used
- AlphaFold (structure prediction)
- Chimera (visualization)
- Tissue Culture, Dot blotting (Western Blotting)
