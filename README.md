# MoleculesAndMachines
Biotechnologist by training, innovator at heart. I use AI tools like AlphaFold &amp; Chimera to study how viruses like SARS-CoV-2 enter cells. Skilled in tissue culture &amp; Western blotting, I'm passionate about solving real-world health puzzles and exploring research at the intersection of biology &amp; AI.
